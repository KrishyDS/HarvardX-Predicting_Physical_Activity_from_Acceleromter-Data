Predicting Physical Activities from Accelerometer Data
PH526x Self Project(edx) | Harvard University
• Predicted the type of physical activity from tri-axial smartphone accelerometer data obtained through Beiwe
• Designed a model trained on Gradient Boosting Classifier with highest accuracy of 86% on test-datasets
• Used the siml and sensor motion libraries for these predictions and implemented Frequency Transformations
• Obtained an average efficiency of 80% with Random Forest, Gradient Boosting classifier and Decision trees
